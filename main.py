# 1. Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output). 
# Sample String : "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world 
# so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are" 
# Output :

# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# 	How I wonder what you are! 
# 		Up above the world so high,   		
# 		Like a diamond in the sky. 
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
# 	How I wonder what you are



# 2. Write a Python program to display the current date and time.
# Sample Output : 
# Current date and time : 
# 2014-07-05 14:34:14


# 3. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.
# Sample Output : 
# r = 1.1
# Area = 3.8013271108436504

# 4. Write a Python program which accepts the users first and last name and print them in reverse 
# order with a space between them.

# 5. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from 
# user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers. Go to the editor
# Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
# Output : 
# List : ['3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23'] 
# Tuple : ('3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23')

# 6. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
# Sample String : google.com'
# Expected Result : {'o': 3, 'g': 2, '.': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1, 'm': 1, 'c': 1}

# 7. Write a Python program to get the largest number from a list

# 8. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.
# [ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ] 
# Expected Output : 
# 60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
# 45°F is 7 in Celsius 

# 9. Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list. Go to the editor
# Sample List : (8, 2, 3, 0, 7)
# Expected Output : 20 

# 10. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" 
# instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
# Sample Output : 
# fizzbuzz
# 1
# 2
# fizz
# 4 
# buzz
